                    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented
                        scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
                        for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                        lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
                        developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                        Java script lives inside a host enviroment (a
                        web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the
                        objects of these environments to provide programmatic
                        control over them.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="body_list_name">Variable Declaration</span>
                            JavaScript variables are conatiners for storing
                            data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
                            the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                            All JavaScript variables must be identified with
                            unique names. These unique names are called
                            identifiers. <span class="examples">var x;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="body_list_name">Variable Assignment
                            </span> Assignment operatorsassign values to
                            JavaScript variables - our cup can now
                            have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a
                            value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a
                            value to a variable.
                            <span class="examples">var x = 10;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="body_list_name">Data Types</span> Data
                            Types are an important concept; to be able to
                            operate on variables you need to know the data
                            type. There are six data types that are JavaScript
                            primitives: Boolean -
                            <span class="examples">true</span>
                            or
                            <span class="examples">false;</span>
                            null -
                            <span class="examples">null</span>
                            aka nothing; Number -
                            <span class="examples">42</span>
                             or
                            <span class="examples">3.14159;</span>
                            String -
                            <span class="examples">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                            Array -
                            <span class="examples">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span>
                            and Object -
                            <span class="examples">{first_name:"Jane", last_name:"Doe"}</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="body_list_name">Conditionals</span> When you right code, you want to
                            perform different actions for different decisions -
                            hitting different code blocks based on values or
                            conditions that have been met. You can use
                            conditional statements in your code to accomplish
                            this. There are the following conditional
                            statements: <span class="examples">if</span> a specified condition is true, do
                            this code in our code block; <span class="examples">else if</span> to specify a
                            new condition to test, if the first condition is
                            false; <span class="examples">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="body_list_name">Loops</span> There are
                            many different kinds of loops in every programming
                            language, but they all
                            essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an
                            action some number of times. Imagine you have to
                            run a mile, well you run around the track four
                            times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="body_list_name">Function</span>
                            Functions are an encaspulation of a code
                            block. When we call our function this will run that
                            code block. Think of it as a list of instructions.
                            As an example imagine we are putting together a
                            desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual
                            and get started, first we screw the legs to the
                            table top; next we place the table the right way
                            up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there
                            are a ton more tables to do so lets call our
                            function over and over and over again.
                        </li>
